# LLMs for Automating WDNs Optimization

This project provides a multi-agent framework for automating optimization tasks in WDNs using LLMs such as DeepSeek.

## âœ… Requirements

- Python 3.11 is **recommended**.
- Dependencies are listed in `requirements.txt`.

This project uses LLMs (e.g., DeepSeek) and requires you to configure your own API key.

You must set the API key as a global environment variable named `OPENAI_API_KEY` before running the project.
